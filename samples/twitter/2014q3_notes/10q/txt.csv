Acquisitions In May 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of privately held Gnip, Inc. (Gnip), a leading provider of social data and analytics headquartered in Boulder, Colorado. The acquisition is expected to allow the Company to further enhance its data analytics capabilities. Under the terms of the acquisition, the Company agreed to pay $107.3 million in cash and issue a total of 0.6 million shares of common stock including shares of restricted stock subject to continued employment in consideration of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Gnip. In addition, the Company agreed to issue up to 0.4 million shares of the Companys stock as a result of assumed Gnip equity awards held by individuals, who will continue to provide services to the Company. The fair value of total consideration of $134.1 million, including the earned portion of assumed stock options and other equity awards, was preliminarily allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values at closing as follows: $23.2 million to developed technology, $9.3 million to customer relationships, $9.1 million to tangible assets acquired, $5.8 million to liabilities assumed, $6.4 million to deferred tax liability recorded, and the excess $104.7 million of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is primarily attributable to the potential expansion and future development of the Companys data products, expected synergies arising from the acquisition and the value of acquired talent. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. Both developed technology and customer relationships will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 60 months. The discounted cash flow method, which calculates the fair value of an asset based on the value of cash flows that the asset is expected to generate in the future, was used to estimate the fair value of thes"

Net Loss per Share The Company computes net loss per share of common stock in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities. The Company considers the shares issued upon the early exercise of stock options subject to repurchase to be participating securities, because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a dividend is paid on common stock. Prior to their conversion to common stock, the Company also considered all series of the Companys redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible preferred stock to be participating securities as the holders of the preferred stock were entitled to receive a noncumulative dividend on a pari passu basis in the event that a dividend was paid on common stock. The holders of all series of convertible preferred stock and the holders of early exercised shares subject to repurchase do not have a contractual obligation to share in the losses of the Company. As such, the Companys net losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 were not allocated to these participating securities. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing total net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding. The weighted-average common shares outstanding is adjusted for shares subject to repurchase such as unvested restricted stock granted to employees in connection with acquisitions, contingently returnable shares and escrowed shares supporting indemnification obligations that are issued in connection with acquisitions and unvested stock options exercised. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding including potential dilutive common stock instruments. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, the Companys potential common stock instruments such as stock options, RSUs, shares to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)"

Income Taxes The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-US activities are subject to local country income tax. The material jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to potential examination by taxing authorities include the United States, California and Ireland. The Company is currently under an income tax examination in California for tax years 2010 and 2011. The Company believes that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. The Company does not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are to be reinvested indefinitely outside the U.S. The Company computes its quarterly income tax provision by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjusts for any discrete items arising during the quarter. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $5.6 million and an income tax provision of $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and an income tax benefit of $4.4 million and an income tax provision of $1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The income tax benefit increased in the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the same periods last year, primarily due to the deferred income tax benefits related to acquisitions concluded during the current quarter, partially offset by increased foreign and state income tax expense. As of June 30, 2014, based on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the U.S. losses incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2014 will not be realized by the end of the 2014 fiscal year. Accordingly, the Company did not record the tax benefits of the U.S. losses incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2014. The primary difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate relates to the valuation allowances on the Companys net operating"

The new guidance provides that a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit would be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward, if such settlement is required or expected in the event the uncertain tax position is disallowed. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively for unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1, 2014. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a $15.8 million decrease in net deferred tax assets and the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits. In May 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update on revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The new guidance will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance. According to the new guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017 and can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard update on the financial statements and related disclosures. In June 2014, the FASB issued new accounting standard update on stock-based compensation when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The new guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a pe"

As of June 30, 2014, no dividends have been declared. Restricted Common Stock The Company has granted restricted common stock to certain key continuing employees in connection with the acquisitions.
